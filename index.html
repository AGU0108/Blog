                    <h5 class="text_succes"> I visited DisneyLand in August 2019</h5>
                    <p class="text_muted">Disney is a magical and awesome place to go for a vacation!
                        In my opinion Magic Kingdom was the best park!! There is the castle and at night there 
                        is a show that is so amazing that when is your last day you are gonna crie!
                        One tip I give you is that you need to pack in your backpack some lunches and water
                        because you have to walk a lot! Another tip is that if you want to get in a lot of rides
                        I recommend you to be at the park at 8:00am because you will probably make almost a 3 hour
                        line just for a ride. One more thing you can not forget while you are there is to
                        BUY MINNE MOUSE EARSSS!! </p>

                    <h4 class="text_capitalize"> <kbd>New York City</kbd></h4>
                    <h5 class="text_succes"> I visited NYC in December 2021</h5>
                    <p class="text_muted">NYC is a really nice city!! There is a lot of turism you can visit!!!
                        One of my favorite places was Time Square. The first advice I give you is that as Disney you also have to 
                    walk a lot!!! So since you have to walk a lot I recommend that you don't have to much weight.
                    Another tip is that you ALWAYS have your MetroCard with you because you are going to be from 
                    train to train so you need you MetroCard for you to pay!! Last is if you want to explore Manhattan you
                    have to have a GPS, why am I telling you this is because it was my own experience!! Trust me it was
                    terrible when you have a dad who lived there 4o years ago and thinks he stills remember EVERYTHING!</p>

                    <h5 class="text_succes"> I visited Washington at the end of December and at the beginning of January </h5>
                    <p class="text_muted">Washington is a really calm and nice state to live!! I went to pass
                                    time with my family I haven't seen in years!! One tip is that if you are on a snowy day
                                    DO NOT GO OUTSIDE because its dangerous!! The most lovely season is december because if you go to some streets
                                    near a lake you can see some Geese flying away because it their season. If you are reading this and you have a 
                                    girlfriend and you want to marry her, then just ask her in Washington at 8:37pm right in front of White house
                                    on a monday night, on 1st of January and she will say yes! (This is a personal experience! =) </p>

                            <p>Hannah Montana is one of my favorite series because it shows
                                how sometimes being two persons and being famous is hard to be.
                                It is a series full of lessons like why is it better to say the truth or 
                                just belive in your self. On another hand it has great images and great
                                music!!! My favorite song is The Climb!!! There are a lot more characters like
                                Lily,Oliver,Jake,Roby,Mamaw,Jesse,Jackson,Rico,Sarah and many more!! My favorite scene
                                is in episode one when Miley aka Hannah puts a pie on her face just
                                because her BFF Lily didn't know that HM was her!! </p>

                <p>The journey starts off full of promise, then quickly takes several wrong turns. Gas station bathrooms, crazed seagulls, a fender bender, and a runaway pig—not exactly Greg Heffley's idea of a good time. But even the worst road trip can turn into an adventure—and this is one the Heffleys won't soon forget.</p>
